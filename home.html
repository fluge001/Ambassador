									<div class="title">Our History</div>
										 <div class="description"><hr>
										 <p></p>
										 <p>On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under new
											 ownership. The new owners, the Rossi Family, had transformed the
											 space from a tap bar into a restaurant that specialized in pizza and
											 sandwiches. In 1978, the Ambassador was expanded into the space
											 next door, and the second dining room was added. In January 2007,
											 the Ambassador became a non-smoking establishment. To explain the
											 history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line the interior
											 walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem detailing the
											 story. The poem,entitled “Come Fill a Bumper,” has since been printed on
											 the cover of the Ambassador Menu.</P>
	<p></p>
										<p>The first line of the poem mentions “Mr. Rohrbeck,” who was “given a
											job to do.” Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was commissioned by Joseph
											Bosch ( born in Baden, Germany in 1850) to paint the murals specifically
											for the Bosch Brewery (closed in 1978). The murals were later placed in
											the “old Giltedge Bar.” Featuring gnomes in various states ofcelebration,
											the murals are oil on canvas, with several coats of varnish on top for
											preservation. The date that the paintings were sold to the Ambassador
											and transferred from the Bosch Brewery is unclear, but the transaction
											likely took place in the late 40s or early 50s during a remodeling project.</p>
	<p></p>
											<p>The Ambassador retains the original charm and tradition of its original
												inception; in addition to the murals, which have remained in place for
												over 50 years, the original pizza recipe is still used to create the
												Ambassador pizzas.</p> </div>

					<p>On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job
						to do. With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the
						masterpiece on the wall above.First home for the paintings was the
						old Giltedge Bar, east of here, but not too far. Streets were of dirt,
						sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses, business was good.
						Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old time.
						Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a
						speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall” Paintings were rolled and stored
						away, for twelve long years in the dust they lay.At last came nineteen
						thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.Saloons and
						taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once
						more.The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings
						were hung on the walls they now grace.The artist, long gone, would be
						proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them as much as they do.</p></div>
